        "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nDescribed a specific scenario in detail here: https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/2760\r\n\r\nThe general problem is when `requestJson` is used to get a status code and then comparing that to an expected\r\nstatus code via `status == <expected status>`. This pattern does not handle codes that would be returned due to errors like Authentication errors ( 401, 403) , Validation errors (422), Not found (404), etc. Instead of an appropriate error being raised to the user so they can act on it, the error is swallowed and the call returns False.\r\n\r\n# Evaluation\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding of the code, the `is_merged` method uses `requestJson` instead of `requestJsonAndCheck` since the latter would raise an `UnknownObjectException` when a pull request is not merged. This is due to the APIs use of 404 to signify a pull request has not been merged. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls?apiVersion=2022-11-28#check-if-a-pull-request-has-been-merged) for details.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that `requestJsonAndCheck` does not return the `status` so a comparison on that with an expected code is currently not possible. \r\n\r\nThis seems to me like a generic approach is needed that returns `status` and raises exceptions but can ignore certain expected 400+ codes.\r\n\r\n# Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nI see two possible solutions:\r\n1. Modify `requestJsonAndCheck` to return `status` and ignore certain codes like 404 in the is_merged case.\r\n2. Create a new method that returns `status` and validates it's within the expected codes if not it raises an exception.\r\n\r\nI opted not to pursue Solution 1 since it is a breaking change and every call to `requestJsonAndCheck` would need to handle the new `status` returned.\r\n\r\nOpted for Solution 2 since it can be implemented in a rolling basis in the scenarios that require it and `requestJsonAndCheck` could remain as is.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: I am new to the code base so if there's a better way of solving this issue that I have missed let me know.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import github\r\n>>> github_client = github.Github(\"<TOKEN>\")\r\n>>> upstream_repo = github_client.get_repo(\"PyGithub/PyGithub\")\r\n>>> pr = upstream_repo.get_pull(2763)\r\n>>> pr.is_merged()\r\nFalse\r\n# Deleted TOKEN above from my account\r\n>>> pr.is_merged()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"../PyGithub/github/PullRequest.py\", line 727, in is_merged\r\n    status, _, _ = self._requester.requestJsonAndValidateStatus(\"GET\", f\"{self.url}/merge\", {204, 404})\r\n  File \"../PyGithub/github/Requester.py\", line 631, in requestJsonAndValidateStatus\r\n    raise self.createException(status, responseHeaders, data)\r\ngithub.GithubException.BadCredentialsException: 401 {\"message\": \"Bad credentials\", \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/rest\"}\r\n```"

False negatives - a PR could have been merged but `is_merged` returns False. \r\n2. Consumer is not notified in any way that their authentication has expired.\r\n\r\nThis also differs from other methods that I have been using like `pr.get_commits().get_page(0)` or `pr.get_labels().get_page(0)` which fail with the expected `github.BadCredentialsException` as soon as the token expires.\r\n\r\nI also tested with a token that has no access to my organization, but in that case an expected 403 was raised which seems to be handled by `github.GithubRetry`.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

It looks like the URL used to retrieve the GET (just \"url\" in the API response) is not SHA-speciifc, so the content can sometimes be old, depending on how quickly Github's backend/storage gets updated. In my testing, this can sometimes be quite awhile (10+ seconds with a file that is around 300K). Because the updated content SHA returned by the PUT is not checked against the content SHA returned by the GET, no exception is raised.\r\n\r\nMy 2 proposed solutions would be:\r\n\r\n1. Use a URL in the GET that references the SHA returned by the PUT, instead of a generic URL that only references the file/branch. It looks like multiple URLs are returned by the API, one of which might be a better choice.\r\n2. Forego returning content completely in `update_file()`, since the API doesn't return this and it doesn't really make much sense, since any call to `update_file()` requires the content that would be updated in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf either of these sound good or if there are any alternative suggestions, I'd be more than happy to submit a PR."

        "body": "As I'm already familiar with lazy objects & workflows, I would like it to have `lazy==True` to be the default. But because this may be not the best for everyone, I propose adding a default lazy argument to the initial `Github` class constructor which becomes the default for every method called by it. If I gain some time, I will look into implementing it myself. However if someone else is faster to implement it, feel free to implement & submit it yourself.\r\n\r\nThis may be implemented by adding a variable to `Github` which holds the global default, can be set by using the constructor and defaults to `False` (to keep the current behavior the default). Then every method supporting lazy behavior may either look up this global default by itself or a decorator is implemented which replaces the lazy parameter by itself. The default for the method's argument should be set to `None`. Then the following comparison code can be used to resolve the value to use:\r\n```python\r\nlazy_global_default if lazy_method_arg is None else lazy_method_arg\r\n```\r\n\r\n(This issue serves as a reminder for myself.)\r\n\r\nPS: This library looks really good & is easy to use, thanks for the work.\r\n\r\n"

So that test's encoding is really misleading.\r\n\r\nI figure the interface could be improved there, but it's not entirely clear to me whether `PyGithub` is to provide a shallow Python interface to Github or possibly a more high-level one e.g. one could imagine a design where `create_git_blob` would automatically select between encoding depending on the input type (`str` | `bytes`) thus making the explicit encoding unnecessary, the encoding could also be an Enum and default to text-equivalent (`\"utf-8\"`) with base64 being opt-in.\r\n\r\nAn other annoyance with the interface is it looks like github *always returns base64-encoded content*, again depending on the suitability of higher-level API `GitBlob` could have a utility property handling that automatically rather than requiring the user be aware of the issue.

Some events also include additional properties that provide more context about the event resources. Refer to the specific event to for details about any properties that differ from this object format.\r\n\r\nThe properties listed in the table below this are all part of the [`TimelineEvent`](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/TimelineEvent.html) class. However, has mentioned above, there are several event types specific to the Timeline Events API that have additional properties that aren't shared. In fact, the `TimelineEvent` class in PyGitHub includes additional `author_association` and `body` attributes which are in the `commented` and `reviewed` event types and the `source` attribute which is in the `cross-referenced` event. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are plenty of other event types that have additional properties that are not on `TimelineEvent` and I'm wondering how I can access them.

Is there an \"escape hatch\" in the API for accessing these additional attributes? If not, would a PR be accepted that adds these attributes to `TimelineEvent`? It does seem that if one was to try to keep the strong-typing, you'd need to express some sort of sum type that would allow you to properly model the disjointed properties that come from the timeline events API.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can provide.

This results in a bunch of bugs; for instance, trying to get a branch with a `#` in its name fails.\r\n\r\nIt also conceivably introduces some kind of security issue somewhere, since anywhere that an application is passing a user-provided value to one of these methods, a user can exploit this to cause a request to be sent to a malformed URL or to add arbitrary additional path segments to the URL after the interpolated value or to add an arbitrary query string (although I have not been able to think of a realistic exploit based on this, and am not confident that one really exists).\r\n\r\nTo try to fix this, I did a regex search across the whole codebase for\r\n\r\n```\r\nf\"{self.url}/.+{\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich finds expressions like\r\n\r\n```\r\nf\"{self.url}/labels/{label}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```\r\nf\"{self.url}/comments/{id}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nand audited each such expression. If the value being interpolated into the URL was already being explicitly URL-encoded in the method, I left it alone. If it was guaranteed via an `assert isinstance(...)` check to be a number, I left it alone. If it was the `._identity` property of a `PyGithub` object whose `_identity` is guaranteed not to contain any special characters in need of URL-encoding, I left it alone. In all other cases, it was an arbitrary string, and in those cases, I URL-encoded it. I did this even in cases where the argument represented something like a GitHub username which cannot legally contain any special characters that need URL-encoding, for a couple of reasons:\r\n* there *might* be a security benefit to doing so in those cases, for the reason given above\r\n* if somebody tries to look up an illegal username like `foo?bar`, it still seems like the correct thing for the library to do is to faithfully encode that username and send it to the API, and get back an appropriate error from GitHub, rather than sending a malformed URL or a URL where `?bar` is treated as a query string (which might produce a seemingly-nonsensical error that complains about user `foo` not existing, or worse, might actually return existing user `foo`).\r\n\r\nI've manually tested my change to check it fixes getting a branch by name when the branch name contains a `#` character. Here's an attempt to get such a branch without this change:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from github import Github\r\n>>> g = Github()\r\n>>> repo = g.get_repo('ExplodingCabbage/PyGithub')\r\n>>> repo.get_branch('foo#bar')\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/mark/PyGithub/github/Repository.py\", line 1643, in get_branch\r\n    \"GET\", f\"{self.url}/branches/{branch}\"\r\n  File \"/home/mark/PyGithub/github/Requester.py\", line 355, in requestJsonAndCheck\r\n    verb, url, parameters, headers, input, self.__customConnection(url)\r\n  File \"/home/mark/PyGithub/github/Requester.py\", line 378, in __check\r\n    raise self.__createException(status, responseHeaders, output)\r\ngithub.GithubException.GithubException: 404 {\"message\": \"Branch not found\", \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#get-a-branch\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's an attempt *with* this change:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from github import Github\r\n>>> g = Github()\r\n>>> repo = g.get_repo('ExplodingCabbage/PyGithub')\r\n>>> repo.get_branch('foo#bar')\r\nBranch(name=\"foo#bar\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't tested anything else, and indeed am not familiar with several of the API calls I've touched in this PR. I'd appreciate if a maintainer familiar with them could review my changes sceptically, and maybe test them if needed.\r\n\r\nNote that this is kind of a breaking change, since some users may have worked around this bug by calling `urllib.parse.quote` on values in their own code before passing them to PyGithub, and such values will now get doubly encoded. As such, this should be called out as a breaking change in the change notes."
