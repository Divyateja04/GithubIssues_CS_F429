Tracing further back, I see that problem 1  is caused by  the hard-coded url in ApplicationOAuth.py  line 100 ff, which does not allow flexibility in hostname: ```         headers, data = self._checkError(             *self._requester.requestJsonAndCheck(                 \"POST\",                 \"https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token\",                 headers={\"Accept\": \"application/json\"},                 input=post_parameters,             )         ) ```  I notice that the same problems occur with   ApplicationOAuth.py  function  `refresh_access_token()`.  For now, I bypassed these functions. I can get an access+refresh token by using the `requests` library to post to the correct url, and then directly building  `auth = Auth.AppUserAuth(  ....  )`   according to the template in [ApplicationOAuth.py  line 123 ff](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/blob/ed2af241a9a45ee99caca185ae61679bffda5219/github/ApplicationOAuth.py#L123).

        "title": "Add a requester method to explicitly validate status codes",
        "body": "# Problem  Described a specific scenario in detail here: https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/2760  The general problem is when `requestJson` is used to get a status code and then comparing that to an expected status code via `status == <expected status>`. This pattern does not handle codes that would be returned due to errors like Authentication errors ( 401, 403) , Validation errors (422), Not found (404), etc. Instead of an appropriate error being raised to the user so they can act on it, the error is swallowed and the call returns False.  # Evaluation  From my understanding of the code, the `is_merged` method uses `requestJson` instead of `requestJsonAndCheck` since the latter would raise an `UnknownObjectException` when a pull request is not merged. This is due to the APIs use of 404 to signify a pull request has not been merged. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls?apiVersion=2022-11-28#check-if-a-pull-request-has-been-merged) for details.  The other issue is that `requestJsonAndCheck` does not return the `status` so a comparison on that with an expected code is currently not possible.   This seems to me like a generic approach is needed that returns `status` and raises exceptions but can ignore certain expected 400+ codes.  # Proposed Solution  I see two possible solutions: 1. Modify `requestJsonAndCheck` to return `status` and ignore certain codes like 404 in the is_merged case. 2. Create a new method that returns `status` and validates it's within the expected codes if not it raises an exception.  I opted not to pursue Solution 1 since it is a breaking change and every call to `requestJsonAndCheck` would need to handle the new `status` returned.  Opted for Solution 2 since it can be implemented in a rolling basis in the scenarios that require it and `requestJsonAndCheck` could remain as is.  **NOTE**: I am new to the code base so if there's a better way of solving this issue that I have missed let me know.  # Testing  ``` >>> import github >>> github_client = github.Github(\"<TOKEN>\") >>> upstream_repo = github_client.get_repo(\"PyGithub/PyGithub\") >>> pr = upstream_repo.get_pull(2763) >>> pr.is_merged() False # Deleted TOKEN above from my account >>> pr.is_merged() Traceback (most recent call last):   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>   File \"../PyGithub/github/PullRequest.py\", line 727, in is_merged     status, _, _ = self._requester.requestJsonAndValidateStatus(\"GET\", f\"{self.url}/merge\", {204, 404})   File \"../PyGithub/github/Requester.py\", line 631, in requestJsonAndValidateStatus     raise self.createException(status, responseHeaders, data) github.GithubException.BadCredentialsException: 401 {\"message\": \"Bad credentials\", \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/rest\"} ```"

        "title": "PullRequest.is_merged does not handle token expiration",
        "body": "# Context  I am trying to build some automation using PyGithub and a Github App to authenticate to our organization. The token I can get has an expiration of 1 hour.  The idea of my workflow is to do the following steps: 1. Get a token from Github App 2. Create pull request 3. Notify reviewers 4. Wait for PR to be merged with a flexible timeout to allow reviewers time to review. 5. Once PR is merged, do more steps  The problem arises in 4 if the timeout exceeds 1 hour.  # Problem  In the scenario above I noticed that even after the authentication token has expired, calling `pr.is_merged()` returns `False`.  Looking at the code the behavior I was seeing makes sense: ```     def is_merged(self) -> bool:         \"\"\"         :calls: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/merge <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls>`_         \"\"\"         status, headers, data = self._requester.requestJson(\"GET\", f\"{self.url}/merge\")         return status == 204 ``` since the status of the request with expired token would be 401.  I see two issues with this: 1. False negatives - a PR could have been merged but `is_merged` returns False.  2. Consumer is not notified in any way that their authentication has expired.  This also differs from other methods that I have been using like `pr.get_commits().get_page(0)` or `pr.get_labels().get_page(0)` which fail with the expected `github.BadCredentialsException` as soon as the token expires.  I also tested with a token that has no access to my organization, but in that case an expected 403 was raised which seems to be handled by `github.GithubRetry`.  # Steps to Reproduce  1. Create a Github Token on your account with `repo` access 2. Use token to create a client and get a pull request `pr` 3. Remove Github token from your account 4 . Run `pr.is_merged` .  For example: ``` import github github_client = github.Github(\"<YOUR TOKEN>\")  upstream_repo = github_client.get_repo(\"PyGithub/PyGithub\") pr = upstream_repo.get_pull(2757) pr.is_merged() False pr.get_commits().get_page(0) [Commit(sha=\"7569ac6c33e3682fa42ddf7aee1640198461a557\"), Commit(sha=\"626a0435d063b12f9a9501a282e7371fe8783494\")] # # Remove token from account # pr.is_merged() False pr.get_commits().get_page(0) Traceback (most recent call last):   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>   File \".../site-packages/github/PaginatedList.py\", line 258, in get_page     headers, data = self.__requester.requestJsonAndCheck(   File \".../site-packages/github/Requester.py\", line 442, in requestJsonAndCheck     return self.__check(   File \".../site-packages/github/Requester.py\", line 487, in __check     raise self.__createException(status, responseHeaders, data) github.GithubException.BadCredentialsException: 401 {\"message\": \"Bad credentials\", \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/rest\"} ```  # Workaround  I call `pr.get_commits().get_page(0)` as well to ensure I can catch the token expiration scenario and handle it."

However, with the way the SDK seems to be, I cannot \"new up\" a PR object for example from this data, and instead need to do a GET request to the API to get the PR, even though I have the contents needed in the webhook.

It looks like the URL used to retrieve the GET (just \"url\" in the API response) is not SHA-speciifc, so the content can sometimes be old, depending on how quickly Github's backend/storage gets updated. In my testing, this can sometimes be quite awhile (10+ seconds with a file that is around 300K). Because the updated content SHA returned by the PUT is not checked against the content SHA returned by the GET, no exception is raised.  My 2 proposed solutions would be:  1. Use a URL in the GET that references the SHA returned by the PUT, instead of a generic URL that only references the file/branch. It looks like multiple URLs are returned by the API, one of which might be a better choice. 2. Forego returning content completely in `update_file()`, since the API doesn't return this and it doesn't really make much sense, since any call to `update_file()` requires the content that would be updated in the first place.  If either of these sound good or if there are any alternative suggestions, I'd be more than happy to submit a PR."

It adds the `get_global_advisory` and `get_global_advisories` methods.  It creates a new `GlobalAdvisory` class  and pulls the shared fields into a class both Global and Repository Advisories inherit from. The payloads of the Global and Repository Advisories are similar, but not quite the same. Repository Advisories have fields designed to allow users to submit using the payloads that are returned. Global Advisories have additional fields that do not apply to advisories attached to a repository. I also implemented a few more fields that are present in both, but were not included (CVSS and identifiers).  I have attempted to follow the code style in the other files, happy to update anything where I'm not following convention.   -----  The fact that I renamed some of the files means that the header script is removing the copyright from anyone who was listed in the original file, which seems wrong. But, I'm not sure what the right fix is, any manual editing would be overwritten by the next person to run the script.

But the `user` has a different id than the `invitation` ``` python # DOES NOT WORK user = github.get_user('octocat') org = github.get_organization('github') org.cancel_invitation(user) ```  Example implementation which works: ``` python # WORKS user = github.get_user('octocat') org = github.get_organization('github') for invitation in org.invitations():     if user.login == invitation.login:         org.cancel_invitation(invitation) ```  In the end I wonder, what was the intention to name it `invitee`?"

The API Docs for both [get_repos](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-organization-repositories) and [get_collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28) list a `per_page integer` of 100 and a `Default` of 30.  However, when called against an org with 11,000+ repos and a repo with 3,000+ collaborators, `get_repos()` seems to return all 11K and `get_collaborators()` only returns large but random sized chunks (160-700 observed).   This is definitely a nit, but its also one that I'm happy to help track down :-) It may also be a GitHub API bug, in which case I'd be happy to help track that down on our side.   Unfortunately, I don't have any debug logs, as I already completed the task I was working on. I could probably cobble together a test org/repo if y'all think those logs would be helpful.   Is this something that anyone else has noticed?   Thanks!"

Usually operations run quite quickly and when a change is performed through the API it's immediately visible through the same, however from time to time that is not the case, events (webhooks) can trigger before the operation has returned, and changes can take some time to propagate.  Around repositories, two of the more frustrating issues are:  - The creation of a repository can take time to propagate and be visible after the `create_repo` call has returned, I've not logged the worst delays but at least several seconds, I think having some sort of backoff and only returning from `create_repo` when the repository is \"externally visible\" (a HEAD request on the repo's url returns a 200) would be a good idea. - Even after the repository is visible, there are background setup processes which run, and can prevent the repository's deletion until they are done running, usually this is not an issue as there are interactions with the repository inbetween, but in some cases it can be a problem, IME in the case where ongoing processing blocks deletion the API returns a 403, so `delete` can just retry (with some sleeping) until either the deletion succeeds, or it fails with a 404 (as from time to time the github api will return errors but still go through, though I've mostly observed that when creating PRs)."

Add the implementation of ```requestFile(self, verb, url, parameters, cnx, path)``` to Requester.py (and.pyi).  For this particular function verb, parameters, and cnx are not really needed.  The other functions in GitReleaseAsset don't seem to be passing in cnx and just get a new one from the requester.  The verb isn't really needed for this function, but might be needed for something in the future?  Not really sure what else I might be missing.  Is there anyone willing to do a review of a PR?"

If the filename is changed and pushed upstream (i.e. changing the extension from yaml to yml) the get_workflow will not find the new filename, it will continue to look for \"my_original_workflow.yaml\".  The most frustrating part of this bug is that it's looking for the \"filename\" not the \"name\".  both the new filename as well as the workflow name (which can be retrieved from the [get_workflows](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/Repository.html#github.Repository.Repository.get_workflows) api ) result in a 404 not found error.

        "body": "As I'm already familiar with lazy objects & workflows, I would like it to have `lazy==True` to be the default. But because this may be not the best for everyone, I propose adding a default lazy argument to the initial `Github` class constructor which becomes the default for every method called by it. If I gain some time, I will look into implementing it myself. However if someone else is faster to implement it, feel free to implement & submit it yourself.  This may be implemented by adding a variable to `Github` which holds the global default, can be set by using the constructor and defaults to `False` (to keep the current behavior the default). Then every method supporting lazy behavior may either look up this global default by itself or a decorator is implemented which replaces the lazy parameter by itself. The default for the method's argument should be set to `None`. Then the following comparison code can be used to resolve the value to use: ```python lazy_global_default if lazy_method_arg is None else lazy_method_arg ```  (This issue serves as a reminder for myself.)

Please leave your ideas of supporting this project below.  ### Things the community can do: - try hard to minimize the time effort for maintainers:   - try to investigate the issues yourself, create bug fixes and pull requests   - try to do the same for other users that don't or can't do it   - review others' pull requests so that they are more likely to get approved   - answer other users' question   - *ideally, maintainers only have to approve and merge pull requests,     as well as cut releases or give broad guidance on design decisions* - individuals backed by companies that use this Python package should consider to invest   some of their work time in contributing back to this open-source software project - experienced users can help new users getting started - watch all activities:   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44700269/154294600-fd1b3183-82df-4136-8001-ef09e2adb98a.png) - support maintainer or contributors financially   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44700269/154294202-7c43c439-3b62-494d-83c5-e49c3c5c6775.png)  ### Things maintainers can do: - make the base of maintainers broader, **pass maintainer rights over to active contributors** - delegate code reviews to community members that have contributed or code reviewed before   - invite them directly to specific issues or pull requests - get completed pull requests merged and released - focus on on-boarding new maintainers and code reviewers rather than fixing bugs  ## Who volunteers?  Please leave a comment below if you volunteer for any of these roles: - maintainer (a few hours per week would revive this project) - code reviewer   - get pull requests into a good shape so that maintainers have to spend less time and are more likely to approve - experienced user   - answer questions and resolve issues related to usage of the library, not bugs or new features"

        "title": "Fix handling of `create_git_blob`'s result",
        "body": "`create_git_blob` does not actually return the entire blob object content, per the OpenAPI description it only returns a `short-blob` with the `sha` and `url` properties whereas a \"full\" blob also has `encoding`, `content`, and `size` (and `node_id` but that's not usually relevant).  Fix by marking the `GitBlob` returned as non-complete, this way normal completion will fetch the additional data iff it is accessed.  However testing github's behaviour raises a few more questions here: `testCreateGitBlob` specifies the `latin1` encoding, per github's documentation that's not actually supported but apparently github simply treats anything other than `\"base64\"` as `\"utf-8\"`, which is really \"text\": the json string gets encoded to utf-8 and stored as-is in the blob. So that test's encoding is really misleading.  I figure the interface could be improved there, but it's not entirely clear to me whether `PyGithub` is to provide a shallow Python interface to Github or possibly a more high-level one e.g. one could imagine a design where `create_git_blob` would automatically select between encoding depending on the input type (`str` | `bytes`) thus making the explicit encoding unnecessary, the encoding could also be an Enum and default to text-equivalent (`\"utf-8\"`) with base64 being opt-in.  An other annoyance with the interface is it looks like github *always returns base64-encoded content*, again depending on the suitability of higher-level API `GitBlob` could have a utility property handling that automatically rather than requiring the user be aware of the issue.

The only real divergence between `git-commit` and `file-commit.commit` is that the schema indicates all of `file-commit.commit`'s properties are optional, but I think it's a case of the endpoint being under-specified and the properties *not* being marked required, rather than them being explicitly optional.

Under [Issue event object common properties](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/events/issue-event-types#issue-event-object-common-properties), it's specifically mentioned:  > Issue events all have the same object structure, except events that are only available in the Timeline Events API. Some events also include additional properties that provide more context about the event resources. Refer to the specific event to for details about any properties that differ from this object format.  The properties listed in the table below this are all part of the [`TimelineEvent`](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/TimelineEvent.html) class. However, has mentioned above, there are several event types specific to the Timeline Events API that have additional properties that aren't shared. In fact, the `TimelineEvent` class in PyGitHub includes additional `author_association` and `body` attributes which are in the `commented` and `reviewed` event types and the `source` attribute which is in the `cross-referenced` event.   However, there are plenty of other event types that have additional properties that are not on `TimelineEvent` and I'm wondering how I can access them. As an example, I'd like to be able to access the `sha` property for the [committed](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/events/issue-event-types#committed) event. Is there an \"escape hatch\" in the API for accessing these additional attributes? If not, would a PR be accepted that adds these attributes to `TimelineEvent`? It does seem that if one was to try to keep the strong-typing, you'd need to express some sort of sum type that would allow you to properly model the disjointed properties that come from the timeline events API.

        "title": "Add a bunch of missing urllib.parse.quote calls",
        "body": "There were previously lots of places in PyGithub where public methods take a string value and interpolate it directly into a URL without URL-encoding it. This results in a bunch of bugs; for instance, trying to get a branch with a `#` in its name fails.  It also conceivably introduces some kind of security issue somewhere, since anywhere that an application is passing a user-provided value to one of these methods, a user can exploit this to cause a request to be sent to a malformed URL or to add arbitrary additional path segments to the URL after the interpolated value or to add an arbitrary query string (although I have not been able to think of a realistic exploit based on this, and am not confident that one really exists).  To try to fix this, I did a regex search across the whole codebase for  ``` f\"{self.url}/.+{ ```  which finds expressions like  ``` f\"{self.url}/labels/{label}\" ```  or   ``` f\"{self.url}/comments/{id}\" ```  and audited each such expression. If the value being interpolated into the URL was already being explicitly URL-encoded in the method, I left it alone. If it was guaranteed via an `assert isinstance(...)` check to be a number, I left it alone. If it was the `._identity` property of a `PyGithub` object whose `_identity` is guaranteed not to contain any special characters in need of URL-encoding, I left it alone. In all other cases, it was an arbitrary string, and in those cases, I URL-encoded it. I did this even in cases where the argument represented something like a GitHub username which cannot legally contain any special characters that need URL-encoding, for a couple of reasons: * there *might* be a security benefit to doing so in those cases, for the reason given above * if somebody tries to look up an illegal username like `foo?bar`, it still seems like the correct thing for the library to do is to faithfully encode that username and send it to the API, and get back an appropriate error from GitHub, rather than sending a malformed URL or a URL where `?bar` is treated as a query string (which might produce a seemingly-nonsensical error that complains about user `foo` not existing, or worse, might actually return existing user `foo`).  I've manually tested my change to check it fixes getting a branch by name when the branch name contains a `#` character. Here's an attempt to get such a branch without this change:  ``` >>> from github import Github >>> g = Github() >>> repo = g.get_repo('ExplodingCabbage/PyGithub') >>> repo.get_branch('foo#bar') Traceback (most recent call last):   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>   File \"/home/mark/PyGithub/github/Repository.py\", line 1643, in get_branch     \"GET\", f\"{self.url}/branches/{branch}\"   File \"/home/mark/PyGithub/github/Requester.py\", line 355, in requestJsonAndCheck     verb, url, parameters, headers, input, self.__customConnection(url)   File \"/home/mark/PyGithub/github/Requester.py\", line 378, in __check     raise self.__createException(status, responseHeaders, output) github.GithubException.GithubException: 404 {\"message\": \"Branch not found\", \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#get-a-branch\"} ```  And here's an attempt *with* this change:  ``` >>> from github import Github >>> g = Github() >>> repo = g.get_repo('ExplodingCabbage/PyGithub') >>> repo.get_branch('foo#bar') Branch(name=\"foo#bar\") ```  I haven't tested anything else, and indeed am not familiar with several of the API calls I've touched in this PR. I'd appreciate if a maintainer familiar with them could review my changes sceptically, and maybe test them if needed.  Note that this is kind of a breaking change, since some users may have worked around this bug by calling `urllib.parse.quote` on values in their own code before passing them to PyGithub, and such values will now get doubly encoded. As such, this should be called out as a breaking change in the change notes."

The logic then tests to see if 'link' is not in headers which in my case there is a 'link' so it falls to the else side and parses the lastUrl line for 'page' which is 1000.  Problem though is that in my search, the original 'data' structure has a valid 'total_count' field of 3041 so I'm not sure why the logic tries to derive something from the lastUrl which is generating an incorrect value?  And if I iterate through the PaginatedList returned I count only 1020 items so I'm not able to iterate through all 3041 items.
