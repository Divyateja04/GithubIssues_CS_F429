# Github Issues - CS F429

-   The main idea of this project was to ensure better workflow experiences for developers in an open source environment. This toolkit essentially consists of multiple scripts:

## Skipgram

-   The skipgram folder consists of two files, one to train the skipgram model itself and one to check the most close by filenames

## Dataset Generation

-   dataset_commit generates all the commit data
-   dataset_commit generates commit data on a per file basis
-   dataset_generate_pairs generates all sets of possible pairs between files so as to correlate them
-   dataset_issues generats issues dataset
